  ffffffd200000000 - 0xfffffff200000000 linear mapping of all physical memory

Architecture defines virtual address bits in multiples of nine starting
from 39. These are referred to as Sv39, Sv48, Sv57 and Sv64. Currently
only Sv39 is supported. Bits 63 through to the most-significant implemented
bit are sign extended. This causes a hole between user space and kernel
addresses if you interpret them as unsigned.

The direct mapping covers as much of the physical memory space as
possible so may cover some IO memory but not all of it.
